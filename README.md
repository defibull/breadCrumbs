Find the world as you let the world find you 
Imagine the Georgia Tech campus scattered with hidden "iBeacons". A user with our app would get a notification whenever they are near one of these beacons. They can interact with this beacon by learning more about the location. Additionally, they can anonymously post stories to the beacon for other people to read. Think Yik Yak, but on a more intimate level. These beacons are completely isolated from the internet. Users are incentivized on searching for them as they get to know the experience of almost everyone who passed the landmark before them.
The app uses iBeacon technology (http://www.ibeacon.com/) to store and load data (simple text files) local to the landmark itself.
